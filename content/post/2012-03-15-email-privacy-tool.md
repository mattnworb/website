[Cool tool][ept] that I found today, which tests how much of your privacy your
email client leaks when it displays an email (by displaying remote images or
other content). Some quick results of different email clients:

 * iPhone 4 iOS 5.1 native mail app, remote images enabled (by default): leaks
   17 out of 32 categories
 * iPhone 4 iOS 5.1 native mail app with remote images disabled: leaks 0 out of
   32 categories (**the winner**)
 * Outlook for Mac 2011, remote images disabled: leaks 2 out of 32 categories
   (audio and video)
 * Macâ€™s built-in Mail.app v4.5, remote images disabled: leaks 14 out of 32
   categories
