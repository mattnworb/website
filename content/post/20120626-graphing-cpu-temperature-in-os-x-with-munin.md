Last week I made a plugin for [Munin][] to collect the temperature of my
Macbookâ€™s CPU, hard drive, and GPU, for no real reason other than I thought it
would be need to see how they change over time, and because graphs are
irresistible.

The [plugin is on github][github-link]. It requires a free app called
[Temperature Monitor][] to be installed so the temperature values can be
collected in a script (I could not find any way built into OS X to collect the
data from the command-line, like you would read /proc on Linux).
