This was harder than I expected it to be:

1. Press ⌘ ⌥ T to bring up the Character Viewer.
2. Click the gear menu (⚙) to bring up options and choose “Customize List…”
3. Under Symbols, check the box next to Technical Symbols
4. The command symbol (⌘) should be the first in the list.

From here you can drag and drop the ⌘ to whatever text editor you want - although a keystroke to type it would be far easier rather than opening Character Viewer each time.

Is there an easier way to do this?
