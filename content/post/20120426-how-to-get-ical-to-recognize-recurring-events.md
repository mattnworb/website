Here is the solution to a problem I recently debugged which I had a very hard
time finding any information on via Google. Hopefully this helps someone else
in the future.

When programatically generating [iCalendar][] (.ics) files, iCal on OS X (at
least on my Snow Leopard version, 4.0.4) seems to refuse to recognize that the
event is recurring if the `VEVENT` contains a `RECURRENCE-ID` element.

For an event that should repeat on the first Thursday of the month, iCal would
only add the first event if the ICS file looked like this:

```
BEGIN:VEVENT
DTSTAMP:20120425T210028Z
DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:20120503T180000
DTEND;TZID=America/New_York:20120503T190000
SUMMARY:This event should repeat on first Thursday of the month
RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=1;COUNT=4;BYDAY=1TH
RECURRENCE-ID;TZID=America/New_York:20120503T180000
```

However, remove the `RECURRENCE-ID` element and iCal recognizes that this is a
recurring event just fine - it adds events on the first Thursday of the month
for four months:

```
BEGIN:VEVENT
DTSTAMP:20120425T210028Z
DTSTART;TZID=America/New_York:20120503T180000
DTEND;TZID=America/New_York:20120503T190000
SUMMARY:This event should repeat on first Thursday of the month
RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=1;COUNT=4;BYDAY=1TH
```

Outlook 2011 and Google Calendar recognize the first example as hoped for
(shows an event that repeats on first Thursday of the month four times). Itâ€™s
not clear to me from [the RFC][] which behavior is correct - the meaning of
`RECURRENCE-ID` seems confusing.
